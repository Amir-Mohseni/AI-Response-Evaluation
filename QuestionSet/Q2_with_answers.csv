1,Combinatorics,"Show that there exists a subset of X with at least ⎿√n⏌ elements which does not contain any of the Ai’s.","Call the elements of X b1, b2, …, bn. Let S be the largest subset of X not containing any of the Ai’s. Let |S| = k. We want to show that k ≥ ⎿√n⏌. Now comes the crucial observation. For any element x in X but not in S, there exists a pair of elements {y, z} in S such that {x, y, z} = Ai for some i. Otherwise, we could add x to S, and the new set would still not contain any set Ai, contradicting our assumption that S is the largest set satisfying this property. Thus, we can construct a mapping from elements in X \ S to pairs of elements in S such that the element in X \ S together with the pair of elements it is mapped to forms one of the sets Ai. Moreover, it cannot happen that two distinct elements in X \ S are mapped to the same pair of elements. If this happened, say x1 and x2 were both mapped to {y, z}, then {x1, y, z} = Ai and {x2, y, z} = Aj for some i and j, and then |Ai ∩ Aj|= 2. This violates condition 2 of the problem. Thus, the mapping we have constructed is injective. This implies that the number of elements in X \ S cannot exceed the number of pairs of elements in S. Hence, we get (n – k) ≤ (k choose 2). This simplifies to k^2 + k ≤ 2n, and from this, the result easily follows (remember that k is an integer). Therefore, k ≥ ⎿√n⏌."
2,Combinatorics,"Show that it is possible to partition the vertex set V of a graph G on n vertices into two sets V1 and V2 such that any vertex in V1 has at least as many neighbors in V2 as in V1, and any vertex in V2 has at least as many neighbors in V1 as in V2.","What properties would such a partition have? Intuitively, such a partition would have lots of ‘crossing edges’, that is, edges joining a vertex in V1 to a vertex in V2. This suggests the following idea: Take the partition maximizing the number of crossing edges. We claim that such a partition satisfies the problem conditions. This can be related to the Max-Cut problem in combinatorial optimization, which aims to partition the vertices of a graph to maximize the number of edges between the two sets. Such a partition inherently ensures that each vertex in one set has at least as many neighbors in the other set as in its own set."
3,Combinatorics,"Can you cover all the black squares with non-overlapping L-trominoes? When it is possible, what is the minimum number of L-trominoes needed?","Let n = 2k+1. Consider the black squares at an odd height (that is, in rows 1, 3, 5, …, n). The key observation is that each L-tromino can cover at most one of these squares. There are (k+1)^2 such squares, so at least (k+1)^2 L-trominoes are needed. These L-trominoes cover a total of 3(k+1)^2 squares. For n = 1, 3 or 5, this exceeds n^2, so we require n ≥ 7 and at least (k+1)^2 L-trominoes. To construct tilings, induct with step 2. The base case 7 is left to the reader (do it systematically: start with the corners and then keep covering black squares of odd height). For example, on a 7x7 board, you can start by placing L-trominoes in the corners and then progressively cover the remaining black squares. Given a 2k+1 × 2k+1 board, divide it into the top left (2k-1) × (2k-1) board along with a border of thickness 2. The (2k-1) × (2k-1) board can be tiled with k^2 tiles by induction. Now tile the border with 2k+1 squares (this is left to the reader again). This shows that (k+1)^2 L-trominoes are sufficient, so the answer is n ≥ 7 and (k+1)^2 L-trominoes are necessary and sufficient."
4,Combinatorics,"There are n boxes B1, B2, …, Bn in a row. N balls are distributed amongst them (not necessarily equally). If there is at least one ball in B1, we can move one ball from B1 to B2. If there is at least one ball in Bn, we can move one ball from Bn to Bn-1. For 2 ≤ k ≤ (n -1), if there are at least two balls in Bk, we can remove two balls from Bk and place one in Bk+1 and one in Bk-1. Show that whatever the initial distribution of balls, we can make each box have exactly one ball.","We use induction and monovariants. The base cases n =1 and 2 are trivial. Suppose we have an algorithm An-1 for n-1 boxes; we construct an algorithm An for n boxes. We use two steps. The first step aims to get a ball into Bn and the second uses the induction hypothesis. Step 1: If Bn contains at least one ball, move to step two. Otherwise, all n balls lie in the first (n-1) boxes. Assign a weight 2^k to box Bk. Now keep moving balls from the boxes B1, B2, …, Bn-1 as long as possible. This cannot go on indefinitely as the total weight of the balls is a positive integer and strictly increases in each move but is bounded above by n2^n. Thus, at some point, this operation must stop, ensuring that we can get a ball into Bn. Step 2: Apply the induction hypothesis to the first (n-1) boxes. If any of the first (n-1) boxes has more than one ball, move extra balls to Bn. Eventually, we can ensure that each box has exactly one ball."
5,Combinatorics,"Let A1, A2, …, A6 be subsets of S = {1, 2, …, 8}. Suppose each set Ai has 4 elements and each element in S is in m of the Ai’s. Find m.","We draw an incidence matrix with six rows, representing the subsets A1, A2, …, A6, and eight columns representing the elements of S. The entry in the ith row and jth column is 1 if and only if the element j belongs to Ai. Otherwise, the entry is 0. Since |Ai| = 4, each row contains four 1s. There are 6 rows, so the total number of 1s in our matrix is 6×4 = 24. Now each element of S is in m of the Ai’s. Thus, each column of our matrix contains m 1s. So the total number of 1s in the matrix is 8m since there are 8 columns. Thus, 24 = 8m, so m = 3."
