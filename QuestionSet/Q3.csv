A lazy bartender is trying to reduce his effort by limiting the drink recipes he must memorize. Given a dictionary input, return the fewest number of drinks he must learn in order to satisfy all customers. For the input above, the answer would be 2, as drinks 1 and 5 will satisfy everyone."
,Coding,"Given an N by M matrix consisting only of 1's and 0's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area."
,Coding,"Write a function, `throw_dice(N, faces, total)`, that determines how many ways it is possible to throw N dice with some number of faces each to get a specific total. For example, `throw_dice(3, 6, 7)` should equal 15."
,Coding,"You are given an array of length N, where each element i represents the number of ways we can produce i units of change. For example, [1, 0, 1, 1, 2] would indicate that there is only one way to make 0, 2, or 3 units, and two ways of making 4 units. Given such an array, determine the denominations that must be in use. In the case above, for example, there must be coins with value 2, 3, and 4."
,Coding,"A typical American-style crossword puzzle grid is an \(N \times N\) matrix with black and white squares, which obeys the following rules: every white square must be part of an ""across"" word and a ""down"" word; no word can be fewer than three letters long; every white square must be reachable from every other white square; the grid is rotationally symmetric (for example, the colors of the top left and bottom right squares must match). Write a program to determine whether a given matrix qualifies as a crossword grid."
,Coding,"Given a linked list, rearrange the node values such that they appear in alternating low -> high -> low -> high form. For example, given 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, you should return 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4."
