How many straight lines can be formed by 8 points of which 3 are collinear?,"To find the number of straight lines that can be formed by 8 points, you need to use the combination formula. This is because a line requires at least two points.

The combination formula is defined as follows:
     C(n, r) = n! / [(r!) * (n-r)!]
where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and ""!"" denotes the factorial of a number.

Firstly, consider the eight points, of which three are collinear (i.e. they lie on the same line). These three collinear points can form only 1 line. Therefore, we should consider them as a single point. This results in a total of 6 points (5 individual points and 1 combined point) which can form lines. 

For these 6 distinctive points, we can select 2 points in C(6, 2) = 6! / [2! * (6-2)!] = 15 ways. 

This means that a total of 15 different lines can be drawn from these 6 points.

But, we haven't considered the internal combination of the 3 collinear points. 

So, we add the 3 lines that can be made by the 3 collinear points, C(3, 2)= 3! / [2! * (3-2)!] = 3.

Therefore, the total number of straight lines that can be formed by 8 points of which 3 are collinear is 15 (from the 6 distinctive points) + 3 (from the 3 collinear points) = 18 lines.","8C2 - 3C2 + 1 (general formula ""nC2 - rC2 + 1"")"
How many triangles can be formed by 8 points of which 3 are collinear?,"To form a triangle, you need to choose 3 points. If no 3 points are collinear (are in a straight line), you can easily do this by applying the combination formula ""n choose 3"", where n is the number of points.

In this case, we have 8 points, but 3 of them are collinear. Let's separate these points into two groups:

1. 3 collinear points
2. 5 other points

First, consider all 8 points. The total number of triangles that can be formed is 8C3 = 8!/(3!*(8-3)!) = 56.

However, this number includes the triangles that can be formed with the 3 collinear points. A triangle can't be formed from 3 collinear points (since they're in a straight line), so we need to subtract the number of these ""triangles"".

The number of ""triangles"" that includes collinear points is 3C3 = 3!/(3!*(3-3)!) = 1 (it's only one triangle because we have only one way to choose all 3 collinear points).

So, the number of triangles that can be formed by 8 points of which 3 are collilinear is 56 - 1 = 55.","8C3 - 3C3 (general formula ""8C3 - rC3"")"
How many committees of 5 students can be selected from a class of 25?,"This problem can be solved using the combinations formula which is often denoted as C(n, r) or ""n choose r"". This formula calculates the number of combinations of ""n"" total items when you're choosing ""r"" items at a time, and it is defined as:

C(n, r) = n! / [(n-r)! * r!]

""!"" denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to a given number.

So in this case, we're choosing a committee of 5 students (r=5) from a total of 25 students (n=25). 

Plugging these numbers into the formula gives us:

C(25, 5) = 25! / [(25-5)! * 5!]

First, calculate the factorial for the smaller numbers:

5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
20! = 20 * 19 * 18 * 17 * 16 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 

To calculate 25!, since we already know the value of 20!, we just need to add the multiplication of the remaining numbers:

25! = 25 * 24 * 23 * 22 * 21 * 20!
= 25 * 24 * 23 * 22 * 21 * (20 * 19 * 18 * 17 * 16 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) 

Then implement the rest into the combination formula:

C(25, 5) = 25! / (20! * 5!)
= (25 * 24 * 23 * 22 * 21 * 20!) / (20! * 120)
= (25 * 24 * 23 * 22 * 21) / 120

We should calculate this equation:

= 53,130

So, there are 53,130 ways to choose a committee of 5 students from a class of 25.",Choose 5 out of 25 = 25C5 = 53130
How many 10-letter patterns can be formed from the letters of the word “BASKETBALL”?,"The word ""BASKETBALL"" has 10 letters which include 1 'B', 2 'A's', 1 'S', 2 'K's', 1 'E', 1 'T', 2 'L's'. 

This could be interpreted as a permutation of 10 items which include four distinctive letters appearing twice ('A', 'K' and 'L') and three unique letters ('B', 'S', 'E', 'T').

The formula of permutations of a multiset, say for example you have n total things out of which p of one kind, q of another kind, r of another kind etc. is given by:

(n!) / [(p!)*(q!)*(r!)..] 

Applying this to our problem, we get:

Let,
n = 10 (total number of the letters),
p, q, and r = 2 (number of the letters ""A"", ""K"", ""L"" which appear twice),
s, t, u, v = 1 (number of the letters ""B"", ""S"", ""T"", ""E"" which appear once).

Therefore, the number of 10-letter patterns can be formed from the letters of the word “BASKETBALL” is:

(10!) / [(2!)*(2!)*(2!)*(1!)*(1!)*(1!)*(1!)] 

By simplifying this:

= (10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2) / [ (2*1) * (2*1) * (2*1) * 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 ]

= 1,814,400 different patterns.

Hence, there are 1,814,400 different 10-letter patterns that can be formed by the letters of the word ""BASKETBALL"".","Total letters=10, B=2, A=2, S=1, K=1, E=1, T=1, L=2 so total number of 10 letter words = 604800"
A box contains 12 black and 8 green marbles. How many ways can 3 black and 2 green marbles be chosen?,"We can solve this problem using the concept of combinations in combinatorics. 

Combination is a way of selecting items from a larger set, where order of selection does not matter. It's normally represented as C(n, r), where n is total number of items, and r is number of items to be selected.

Here, we are basically required to perform two tasks:

Task 1: select 3 black marbles out of 12
Task 2: select 2 green marbles out of 8

We'll solve it combining results from both these tasks.

1. The number of ways to select 3 black marbles from 12 is represented as C(12, 3). Using the formula for combinations C(n, r) = n! / [(n-r)! * r!] (where ""!"" represents factorial), we get:

C(12, 3) = 12! / [(12-3)! * 3!] = 12! / (9! * 3!) = (12 * 11 * 10) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 220

This means there are 220 ways we can choose 3 black marbles from a set of 12.

2. Similarly, the number of ways to select 2 green marbles from 8 can be computed as:

C(8, 2) = 8! / [(8-2)! * 2!] = 8! / (6! * 2!) = (8 * 7) / (2 * 1) = 28

So, there are 28 ways to choose 2 green marbles from a set of 8.

3. Because these are independent choices (choosing black marbles doesn't affect choosing green ones), the total number of ways to choose 3 black and 2 green marbles is the product of the individual choices. Thus, it is:

220 (black choices) * 28 (green choices) = 6160

Therefore, there are 6160 different ways to choose 3 black and 2 green marbles from this set.",12C3 + 8C2 = 248
a) How many different ways can the students be assigned seats at the table? b) How many ways can a president and a vice-president be elected from the 8 students?,"To effectively answer this, I will assume that there are 8 students since you mentioned that the committee is composed of 8 students in your second question. 

a) The number of ways to seat 8 students around a table is given by the formula (n-1)!, where n is the number of students. This is because when assigning seats around a table, one particular seat is used as a reference point and does not count separately. Therefore, the formula for this type of permutation is (n-1) factorial.

In this case, there are 8 students, so n = 8

The number of ways 8 students can be assigned seats is therefore:

(8 - 1)! = 7!
Which equals 7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 5040 ways. 

b) If the committee needs to elect a president and a vice-president, then order matters - these are two distinct positions. This is a permutation situation, not a combination situation. Here, out of 8 students, we are interested in permutations of 2. 

The number of ways to choose 2 students from 8 is given by the formula P(n, k) = n! / (n - k)! 

Here: 
n = 8 (The number of students)
k = 2 (The number of positions)

So P(8, 2) = 8! / (8 - 2)!

This results in:
P(8, 2) = 8! / 6!
= 8*7*6*5*4*3*2 / 6*5*4*3*2
= 8 * 7 
= 56 ways 

So there are 56 ways a president and vice-president can be elected from the 8 students. 

Side note: Factorial operation (denoted by ""!"") is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the number. For example, 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.",a) 8! ways b) 8C1 x 7C1 = 56
"A Club consists of 20 members, of which 9 are male and 11 are female. Seven members will be selected to form an event-planning committee. How many committees of 4 females and 3 males can be formed?","We want to count the number of ways to form a committee with 4 females and 3 males. Since the order in which we choose the committee members does not matter, we can use combinations (also known as ""choose"" or binomial coefficients).

The formula for the number of combinations of n things taken k at a time is:

C(n, k) = n! / [(n-k)! * k!]

where ""!"" denotes a factorial, meaning the product of all positive whole numbers up to that number (e.g., 4!=4*3*2*1 = 24).

In this case, we first choose the females:

C(11, 4) = 11! / [(11-4)! * 4!]
         = 11! / [7! * 4!] 
         = (11*10*9*8) / (4*3*2*1) 
         = 330

So, there are 330 different ways we could choose 4 females out of 11.

Next, we choose the males:

C(9, 3) = 9! / [(9-3)! * 3!] 
        = 9! / [6! * 3!] 
        = (9*8*7) / (3*2*1)
        = 84

So, there are 84 different ways we could choose 3 males out of 9.

To find the total number of ways to form the committee, we multiply these two results together since for each way of choosing the females, there are multiple ways of choosing the males:

330 (ways to choose females) * 84 (ways to choose males) = 27720

Therefore, there are 27,720 possible committees.",Total number of committees = 11C₄ x ⁹C₃
How many 7-digit telephone numbers can be formed if the first digit cannot be 0 or 1?,"The telephone number is 7-digits, with a restriction on what the first digit can be. Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The first digit: As mentioned, the first digit of the telephone number cannot be 0 or 1. This leaves us with 8 choices for the first digit (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9).

2. The remaining digits: For each of the remaining 6 digits, we have 10 choices each (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). 

3. So, we now apply the counting principle. The counting principle states that if there are n ways to do one thing, and m ways to do another, then there are n*m ways to do both. Therefore, we calculate the total number of telephone numbers as follows:

   Total number = number of choices for first digit * number of choices for second digit * ... * number of choices for the seventh digit
               
   Total number = 8 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10
               
   Total number = 8 * (10^6)
   
   Therefore, there are 8,000,000 different 7-digit telephone numbers that can be formed with these restrictions.",Total number of telephone numbers = 8 x 10^6
Six people are seated at a round table to play a game of cards. a) Is the seating arrangement around the table a linear or circular permutation? b) How many possible seating arrangements are there?,"a) The seating arrangement around the table is a circular permutation.

Reasoning: The main difference between linear and circular permutations is the reference point. In linear permutations, there is a distinct first and last position which can be referenced. In a circular permutation, there is no initial point of reference. For example, when people arrange themselves around a round table, the arrangement is a circle, any person can be considered as a starting point, and similar arrangements in terms of relative position will be counted as the same. Hence, for seating people around a table, we consider circular permutations.

b) The number of possible seating arrangements can be calculated as (n-1)! for circular permutations, where n is the total number of people. The reason is that since there is no unique initial point of reference in a circular permutation, any person can be considered as the starting point.

So, in this case, with 6 people, the total number of seating arrangements would be:

(6-1)! = 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120 possible seating arrangements.",a) Circular permutation b) (6 – 1)! = 120 possible arrangements
"How many different 5-digit street addresses can have the digits 4, 7, 3, 4, and 8?","The problem is a permutations problem where repetition is allowed. 

Here's a breakdown of the problem:

- There are 5 positions to fill for the 5-digit address: _, _, _, _, _.

- The 5 digits are 4, 7, 3, 4, and 8. Notice that the digit '4' is repeated.

Step 1: Make the collection of digits unique. To do this, we can call the first ""4"" as ""4a"" and the second ""4"" as ""4b"". This way, we are making them unique.

So now, our 5 digits become: 4a, 7, 3, 4b, 8.

Step 2: Count the total permutations, treating each digit as unique.

The formula for permutation is nPr = n! / (n-r)!. Notice that there are 5 digits and 5 positions to place these digits, so n = r = 5. The formula simplifies to 5P5 = 5! / 0! = 5!. The factorial of a number n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.

So, there are 120 permutations if each digit is unique.

Step 3: But, we know '4a' and '4b' are not unique, and they are in fact the same digit '4'. 

So, we have to account for their repetitions. There are 2! = 2*1 = 2 ways to arrange these two.

Step 4: To find the actual number of permutations when repetition is allowed, we divide the total number of permutations by the number of ways the repeated items can be arranged.

So, the total number of different 5-digit addresses is 120 / 2 = 60.",Total number of 5-digit addresses = 5! / 2! = 60
Three hardcover books and 5 paperbacks are placed on a shelf. How many ways can the books be arranged if all the hardcover books must be together and all the paperbacks must be together?,"Step 1: Consider all the hardcover books as a single entity and all the paperbacks as a single entity. Therefore, initially we are placing two entities on a shelf which can be done in 2! ways. 

Step 2: Now, each entity contains individual books which can be organized amongst themselves. The hardcover entity contains 3 books which can be organized in 3! ways. Similarly, the paperback entity contains 5 books which can be organized in 5! ways.

Step 3: To get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways the entities can be arranged with the number of ways the books within each entity can be arranged. 

2! (ways to arrange entities) * 3! (ways to arrange hardcovers) * 5! (ways to arrange paperbacks)

= 2 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

= 2 * 6 * 120

= 12 * 120

= 1440 ways

Therefore, the books can be arranged in 1440 different ways if all the hardcover books must be together and all the paperbacks must be together.",2! x 3! x 5!
